When all the dogs needed help\nLawyers and the commissary ain\u2019t gon\u2019 pay itself\nWhere your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?\nWhere your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom\nMan I ain\u2019t got no choice \u2018cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy\nI\u2019m selfmade, selfish with my women, self employed\nI\u2019ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise\nMan, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn\u2019t feed me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn\u2019t need me?\nWhere your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?\nFuck was you at? I had the 6 on my shoulders\n\nWhere your ass was at dog, when niggas wasn\u2019t feed me?\nWhere your ass was at dog, when bitches didn\u2019t need me?\nWhere your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?\nWhere your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out\n60 for a walk thru bitch don\u2019t panic\nHad them bitches fall through fucking like a savage\nHeard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket\nHeard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet\nHeard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet\nHeard a lot of dogs who will call you a mutt\nWhere your ass was at dog, when I was in my cup?\nThe reason I\u2019m here today is cause I never gave up\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas wasn\u2019t feed me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn\u2019t need me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?\nWhere your ass was at, dog?
